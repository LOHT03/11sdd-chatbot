Here are the different systems within the restaurant that should be split into their own classes.
-   Customer Management (Check if new customer, show previous orders, add order under name)
-   Order Management (Instantiate a new order, add items to order, calculate order, )
    -   DB Connection (store orders, linked to the order management system)
-   Menu (Show menu, show menu specific course)
